    \\ Welcome To Soggy Hub.
    \\ Source Code Looks Juicy Right?
    \\ I do not obfuscate my scripts because I want other people to learn how to code
    \\ And they can get inspiration from me from my work I have done on roblox.
    \\ Roblox exploiting may not be positive but it expands the mindset and knowledge of people
    \\ It can also teach them how to reverse engineer in a way and become a white hat hacker
    \\ They can also use exploits and learn how to exploit to see if there is any invulnerablities on their own game!
    \\ This is what I sometimes do to people and I GET PAID to do so, I make an exploit on a game, Script, and then
        tell them how to patch it / fix it in order to prevent other exploiters abusing that exploit
    \\ If you want to donate to me, be free to do so as it helps me out and makes me want to carry on doing what I love
    \\ Yes I do take inspiration from other peoples scripts, if you want credit just create a ticket in my discord
        server and let me know so I can give you that credit.

    \\ Have a good day and happy learning and coding!

    Main Script, We check the games identity document (ID) to see if it is the correct game to execute the script on, if you do it
        on a random game it will just error most likely and definitely not show up with anything, the scripts here will
        only work on the games they are meant to to prevent confusion and stress to why you are wondering it is not working
        inside of the discord server there is a list of the games which the hub works on so make sure you only 
        execute the hub on those specified games
